- object mapper
- static data
- data that changes
- API
- python --> web socket: end to end connection that acts like a file (reading & writing)
- curl [url] --> opens web socket
- screen scraping, python --> will break eventually when the website changes :(

Some websites
- weather.com
- open weather maps

- JSON (just like MongoDB)
